# Amazon Sales Analysis with Power BI

This repository contains a Power BI project focused on analyzing Amazon sales data. The project provides insights into various sales metrics and trends using visualizations created in Power BI.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to leverage Power BI to analyze a dataset of Amazon sales. The dataset includes various attributes such as product categories, sales numbers, and other relevant metrics. The project visualizes these metrics to identify trends and provide actionable insights.

## Key Components

- **Amazon_Sales_Dataset.csv**: This CSV file contains the raw sales data used for analysis. It includes details such as product IDs, sales amounts, categories, and dates.
- **amazon complete.pbix**: This is the main Power BI project file. It contains all the visualizations, data models, and dashboards built using the Amazon sales dataset.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow the instructions below.

### Prerequisites

- **Power BI Desktop**: You will need Power BI Desktop installed on your machine to open and work with the `.pbix` file.
- **Git**: Ensure you have Git installed to clone the repository.

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/manishk050/Amazon-Power-BI.git
    ```
2. **Navigate to the project directory**:
    ```bash
    cd Amazon-Power-BI
    ```
3. **Open the Power BI file**:
    - Double-click the `amazon complete.pbix` file to open it in Power BI Desktop.

### Running the Project

Once the Power BI file is opened in Power BI Desktop, you can explore the various dashboards and visualizations. You can interact with the data, apply filters, and even modify the existing visuals to better suit your analysis needs.

## Additional Documentation

For more detailed information on how the data is processed and visualized, refer to the documentation available within the Power BI file itself. Each visualization is accompanied by descriptions that explain the data and the insights derived from it.

## Notes

- Ensure that the dataset (`Amazon_Sales_Dataset.csv`) is in the same directory as the Power BI file to avoid any issues with data loading.
- If you wish to update the dataset or make modifications, ensure the data is properly formatted to match the existing data model.
